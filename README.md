uLipSync
========

**uLipSync** is an Unity asset to do a realtime lipsync (now supports only **A**, **I**, **U**, **E**, and **O**).

- Fast calculation using Job and Burst compiler
- No native plugin / No dependency

Environment
-----------
- I've created this asset using Unity 2020.1.17f1 on Windows 10 (not tested with other versions and operation systems yet)
- **Burst** and **Mathematics** should be installed in the Package Manager

Get started
-----------
1. Download the latest package from the [Releases](https://github.com/hecomi/uLipSync/releases) page and add it into your project.
2. Attach `uLipSync` component to the GameObject that has `AudioSource` and plays voice sounds.

3. Attach `uLipSyncBlendshape` component to the GameObject of your character.
4. Set parameters of the component. Checking `Find From Children` helps you find the target `SkinnedMeshRenderer` and blendshapes of the character's mouth.

5. Register `uLipSyncBlendshape.OnLipSyncUpdate` to `uLipSync` in Callback section.

6. Choose a profile from `Man` or `Woman` in LipSync Profile section.

7. Play!


Copmonents
----------
### `uLipSync`
This is a core component to calculate lipsync. `uLipSync` gets sound buffers from `MonoBehaviour.OnAudioFilterRead()` so you have to attach this component to the same GameObject that has `AudioSource` to play voice. In `LateUpdate()` phase, this component schedules a job to calculate lipsync parameters, then retrives the result in the future `LateUpdate()` timing when the calculation finishes (typically, the calculation is ~1ms so next frame). All calculation is optimized by Burst compiler.

### `uLipSyncBlendShape`
Update BlendShapes of `SkinnedMeshRenderer` by registering `OnLipSyncUpdate()` to the event handler of `uLipSync` components as described in the above section.

### `uLipSyncMicrophone`

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uLipSync/uLipSync-Microphone.png" width="640" />

Create `AudioClip` that plays Mic input and set it to `AudioSource`. Please attach this component to the same GameObject that has `uLipSync`. You can start / stop the recording from the Script by calling `StartRecord()` / `StopRecord()`. And you can change the input source by changing `index`. `uLipSync.MicUtil.GetDeviceList()` helps you find the desired input.


Parameters
----------

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uLipSync/Section-Parameters.png" width="640" />

- **Volume**
  - **Normalized Volume**
    - Shows the normalized volume calculated using Min Volume and Max Volume
  - **Min Volume**
    - Ignore sounds whose volume is lower than this threshold
  - **Max Volume**
    - Make blendshape value 100 with this threshold (If Auto Volume is checked, this parameter is hidden)
  - **Auto Volume**
    - Calculate Max volume automatically from recent inputs
  - **Auto Volume Amp**
    - Max Volume = current input volume * amp
  - **Auto Volume Filter**
    - Decrease max volume by this filter every frame (MaxVolume *= filter)
- **Smoothness**
  - **Open Smoothness**
    - Speed to open mouth (instant 0.0 <-> 1.0 smooth)
  - **Close Smoothness**
    - Speed to close mouth (instant 0.0 <-> 1.0 smooth)
  - **Vowel Transition Smoothness**
    - Speed to change the shape of mouth (instant 0.0 <-> 1.0 smooth)
- **Output**
  - **Output Sound Gain**
    - Change the volume of output sound
    - If you use `uLipSync` with microphone and don't want to output microphone sound in Unity, please set the gain zero.


Profile
-------

uLipSync detects frequencies of the 1st and the 2nd formants from short sound inputs and guesses the vowel from them.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant

The preset `Man` and `Woman` profiles have typical frequencies of all vowels for men and women. But these frequencies depend on person, so you can create your profiles by cliking `Create` button if you want to optimize the lipsync for the voice you use.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uLipSync/Asset-Profile.png" width="640" />

- **Formant**
  - **F1**
    - the frequency of the 1st formant (Hz)
  - **F2**
    - the frequency of the 2nd formant (Hz)
- **Tips**
  - Typical frequencies are written here
- **Visualizer**
  - X-axis is the 1st formant, and Y-axis is the 2nd formant
  - Please check each formant is not so close
- **Settings**
  - **Use Error Range**
    - If you want to remove the result outer the range in the graph, please check this
  - **Max Error Range**
    - Maximum range from formants (= Radius in the graph)
  - **Min Log 10H**
    - Do not use the formant if the spectrum value is lower than this threshold


Callback
--------

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uLipSync/Section-Callback.png" width="640" />

When lipsync process finishes, the result is notified by this event. The event handler should have a `LipSyncInfo` argument like this:

```c
using UnityEngine;
using uLipSync;

public class DebugPrintLipSyncInfo : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float threshVolume = 0.01f;
    public bool outputLog = true;

    public void OnLipSyncUpdate(LipSyncInfo info)
    {
        if (info.volume > threshVolume && outputLog)
        {
            Debug.LogFormat("MAIN VOWEL: {0}, [ A:{1} I:{2}, U:{3} E:{4} O:{5} N:{6} ], VOL: {7}, FORMANT: {8}, {9}",
                info.mainVowel,
                info.volume,
                info.vowels[Vowel.A],
                info.vowels[Vowel.I],
                info.vowels[Vowel.U],
                info.vowels[Vowel.E],
                info.vowels[Vowel.O],
                info.vowels[Vowel.None],
                info.formant.f1,
                info.formant.f2);
        }
    }
}
```


Config
------

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uLipSync/Section-Config.png" width="640" />

The lipsync process calculates LPC spectral envelope, and parameters for the calculation is defined in this section. You can create your parameter set in the same way as `Profile`. I recommend you NOT to change the default settings if you don't know the details of the calculation.

- **Config**
  - **Default**
    - A recommended setting
  - **Calibration**
    - Needs long time (~ 1 sec) but you can see formants more clearly so that you can check frequencies of formants.
  - **Create**
    - Create a new `Config` asset
- **Sample Count**
  - The number of sound data
- **Lpc Order**
  - LPC (Linear predictive coding) order
- **Frequency Resolution**
  - The division number of LPC spectral envelope (0 Hz ~ Max Frequency)
- **Max Frequency**
  - The maximum frequency to check formants (The highest formant is the 2nd one of vowel I, it's about 3000 Hz)
- **Window Func**
  - Window function to calculate the spectral envelope
    - None: Not apply window
    - Hann: Hanning window
    - Blackman-Harris: Blackman-Harris window
    - Gauss_4_5: Gauss window (sigma = 4.5)
- **Check Second Derivative**
  - To guess formants, the second derivative of the spectral envelope are considered. This is useful when the second formant of O is unclear, but sometimes has a bad influence on other vowels.
- **Check Third Formant**
  - Consider also the third formant to guess vowels. This is useful when an undesired peak appears but also has bad effect sometimes.
- **Filter H**
  - The spectral envelope changes slowly to avoid the noise. This is useful when you want to check formant peaks when adjusting formant values in profile.


Visualizer
----------

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uLipSync/visualizer.gif" width="640" />

Visualizer is useful when you want to check whether the input sound is correctly analyzed with given profile.

- **Draw On Every Frame**
  - To update graphs in realtime, editor script needs to call `Repaint()` every frame. This causes performance issues in the game, so I recommend to check this only when you really want to see them in realtime.
- **Formant Map**
  - X-axis is the 1st formant frequency, and Y-axis is the 2nd formant one.
  - In runtime, white circle indicates the latest result and the ellipse of the vowel gets brighter by it.
- **LPC Spectral Envelope**
  - Draws a graph of LPC spectral envelope and you can see some related information by selecting following checkboxes:
  - **LPC**
    - LPC spectral envelope
  - **dLPC**
    - The second derivative of the envelope
  - **FFT**
    - FFT result
  - **Formant**
    - Current
