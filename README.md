uLipSync
========

**uLipSync** is an Unity asset to do a realtime lipsync (now supports only **A**, **I**, **U**, **E**, and **O**).

- Fast calculation using Job and Burst compiler
- No native plugin / No dependency


Get started
-----------
1. Download the latest package from the [Releases](https://github.com/hecomi/uLipSync/releases) page and add it into your project.
2. Attach `uLipSync` component to the GameObject that has `AudioSource` and plays voice sounds.

3. Attach `uLipSyncBlendshape` component to the GameObject of your character.
4. Set parameters of the component. Checking `Find From Children` helps you find the target `SkinnedMeshRenderer` and blendshapes of the character's mouth.

5. Register `uLipSyncBlendshape.OnLipSyncUpdate` to `uLipSync` in Callback section.

6. Choose a profile from `Man` or `Woman` in LipSync Profile section.

7. Play!


Copmonents
----------
### `uLipSync`
This is a core component to calculate lipsync. `uLipSync` gets sound buffers from `MonoBehaviour.OnAudioFilterRead()` so you have to attach this component to the same GameObject that has `AudioSource` to play voice. In `LateUpdate()` phase, this component schedules a job to calculate lipsync parameters, then retrives the result in the next `LateUpdate()` timing. All calculation is optimized by Burst compiler.

### `uLipSyncBlendShape`
Update BlendShapes of `SkinnedMeshRenderer` by registering `OnLipSyncUpdate()` to the event handler of `uLipSync` components as described in the above section.

### `uLipSyncMicrophone`

Create `AudioClip` that plays Mic input and set it to `AudioSource`. Please attach this component to the same GameObject that has `uLipSync`. You can start / stop the recording from the Script by calling `StartRecord()` / `StopRecord()`. And you can change the input source by changing `index`. `uLipSync.MicUtil.GetDeviceList()` helps you find the desired input.


Parameters

- **Volume**
  - **Normalized Volume**
    - Shows the normalized volume calculated using Min Volume and Max Volume
  - **Min Volume**
    - Ignore sounds whose volume is lower than this threshold 
  - **Max Volume**
    - Make blendshape value 100 with this threshold (If Auto Volume is checked, this parameter is hidden)
  - **Auto Volume**
    - Calculate Max volume automatically from recent inputs
  - **Auto Volume Amp**
    - Max Volume = current input volume * amp
  - **Auto Volume Filter**
    - Decrease max volume by this filter every frame (MaxVolume *= filter)
- **Smoothness**
  - **Opne Smoothness**
    - Speed to open mouse (instant 0.0 <-> 1.0 smooth)
  - **Opne Smoothness**
    - Speed to close mouse (instant 0.0 <-> 1.0 smooth)
  - **Opne Smoothness**
    - Speed to change the shape of mouse (instant 0.0 <-> 1.0 smooth)
- **Output**
  - **Output Sound Gain**
    - Change the volume of output sound
    - If you use `uLipSync` with microphone and don't want to output microphone sound in Unity, please set the gain zero.

Profile
-------

uLipSync detects frequencies of the 1st and the 2nd formants from short sound inputs and guesses the vowel from them.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant

The preset `Man` and `Woman` profiles have typical frequencies of all vowels for men and women. But these frequencies depend on person, so you can create your profiles by cliking `Create` button if you want to optimize the lipsync for the voice you use.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uLipSync/Asset-Profile.png" width="640" />

- **Formant**
  - **F1**
    - the frequency of the 1st formant (Hz)
  - **F2**
    - the frequency of the 2nd formant (Hz)
- **Tips**
  - Typical frequencies are written here
- **Visualizer**
  - X-axis is the 1st formant, and Y-axis is the 2nd formant
  - Please check each formant is not so close
- **Settings**
  - **Use Error Range**
    - If you want to remove the result outer the range in the graph, please check this
  - **Max Error Range**
    - Maximum range from formants (= Radius in the graph)
  - **Min Log 10H**
    - Do not use the formant if the spectrum value is lower than this threshold
